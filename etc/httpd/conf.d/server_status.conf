# If you include mod_status and you also set ExtendedStatus On when building and
# running Apache, then on every request Apache will perform two calls to
# gettimeofday(2) (or times(2) depending on your operating system), and
# (pre-1.3) several extra calls to time(2). This is all done so that the status
# report contains timing indications. For highest performance, set
# ExtendedStatus off (which is the default).

# Allow server status reports generated by mod_status,
