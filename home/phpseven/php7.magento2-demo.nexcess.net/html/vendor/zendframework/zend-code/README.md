# zend-code

`Zend\Code\Generator` provides facilities to generate arbitrary code using an
object-oriented interface, both to create new code as well as to update existing
code. While the current implementation is limited to generating PHP code, you
can easily extend the base class in order to provide code generation for other
tasks: JavaScript, configuration files, apache vhosts, etc.
